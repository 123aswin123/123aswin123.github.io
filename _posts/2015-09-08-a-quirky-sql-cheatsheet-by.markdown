Every backend Dev / wanna be Dev would have a had tryst with SQL. Though SQL is very simple without constant practice one's SQL skills might get rusty. A nifty gist of the basics is here!

If you are a SQL newbie you should check out [this post]('https://123aswin123.github.io/2015/03/26/try-sql-by-codeschool.html'). However if you used to be familiar with SQL and you wish to break the SQL hiatus you should check out __[A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to SQL: A MySQL Tutorial]('https://blog.udemy.com/beginners-guide-to-sql/')__ - a neatly organized short read that would definitely get you back on the CRUD train. This post might come in handy as a quick reference material before your next job interview too!

I know this might be hilarious but this blogpost is a review of another blogpost :P
