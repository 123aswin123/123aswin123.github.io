SQL and databases were not my cup of tea back in college , I must confess that __back then I didn't even know to write a simple SQL select statement__, leave aside those complex joins. Nested queries seemed like nested problems! But today as fate had its say on my destiny, I deal with databases and data manipulation through SQL day in and day out! Getting one's hands dirty is the best way to learn new things! I guess I was naive in college, I got allergic to DBs, I am really happy that I've gotten over that now!

[Code School](https://codeschool.com) is an online programming tutor, they are the people behind ['Try Git'](https://try.github.io) and ['Try Ruby'](http://tryruby.org) and they have launched a brand new first of its kind Video + Interactive course for absolute beginners called ['Try SQL'](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-sql).

I strongly feel classroom learning of SQL can be replaced with these online tutorials. I learned MySQl basics from [SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) however to get comfy with SQL practice is the only key!

####Try SQL by code school teaches only SQL and not other basic Database concepts, If you wish to get a hang of those concepts, a coursera or edX course is highly recommended.
